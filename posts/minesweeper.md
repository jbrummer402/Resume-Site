title: Minesweeper
---
I made this clone of Minesweeper in my AP Computer Science A class during my junior year of high school. It is one of my favorite projects that I have done, since it was quite difficult at the time but I still ended up finishing it.

All of this is coded in Java. I used recursion when calculating the number of mines that surrounds each cell. Then, if the function encounters a cell with 0 mines, it will then recursively reveal the rest of the cells with 0 mines.
