My name is John (Jack) McManus Brummer. I was born in Summit, New Jersey on April 2nd, 1999. I was raised in Chatham, New Jersey my whole life.

I attended my local school district, the School District of the Chathams, starting with the Milton Avenue School and ending in Chatham High School.

I am currently a junior at the Stevens institute of Technology majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Visual Arts and Technology. I hope to eventually become a video game developer with what I learn here.

Over my educational career I have been exposed to so many different areas of computer science and have found an interest in almost all of them. Game development is still what I want to do the most, but there's so many different fields in computer science that would suit me as well.
