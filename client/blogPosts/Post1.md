title: Watchmen keeps me watching
---

I guarantee anyone has their favorite franchise or perhaps genre of media. You can like horror, romance, crime, all of that. Which each one, a certain niche is filled. They fill into an archetype. Now watchmen, I feel, does something interesting. It plays the role of being the anti-archetype. It spits in the face of anyone who holds onto their preconceived notions of what something should be.

And the best part is, each character is kind of an asshole. One of the main protagonists of the movie, the comedian (blake being his real name), is the one who looks at the world and realizes all the bullshit that comes along with it. It's all a fucking joke, and blake is the guy to show everyone. At the same time, you still want to root for him. He's done some absolutely horrible things to woman and children (the vietnam flashbacks).
